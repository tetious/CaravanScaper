**CaravanScraper**
Super simple CasperJS based thing to pull down episodes of Caravan to Midnight and stuff them in an RSS
feed for podcatcher consumption.

Since the show is not free, please do not host the result of this script publically. :) The intent is
for it to end up on a local server for your own use.

You'll need to stuff your CTM credentials into config.json. (username and password)
